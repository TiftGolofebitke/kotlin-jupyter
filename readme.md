# Kotlin kernel for iPython/Jupyter

No evaluation functionality has been implemented yet ("`execute_request`" message and related stuff)

## Debugging

- run kernel jar passing some connection config file as a parameter, e.g. `testData/config.json`
- run `jupyter-console` passing the full path to the same config file as an argument to the `--existing` command line parameter
- enjoy
